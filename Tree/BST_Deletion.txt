Binary Search Tree (Delete)

1) Node to be deleted is leaf: Simply remove from the tree.

              50                            50
           /     \         delete(20)      /   \
          30      70       --------->    30     70 
         /  \    /  \                     \    /  \ 
       20   40  60   80                   40  60   80

2) Node to be deleted has only one child: Copy the child to the node and delete the child

              50                            50
           /     \         delete(30)      /   \
          30      70       --------->    40     70 
            \    /  \                          /  \ 
            40  60   80                       60   80

3) Node to be deleted has two children: Find inorder successor ( a minimum value in the right subtree ).
Copy contents of the inorder successor to the node and delete the inorder successor.


              50                            60
           /     \         delete(50)      /   \
          40      70       --------->    40    70 
                 /  \                            \ 
                60   80                           80

The important thing to note is, inorder successor is needed only when right child is not empty. 
In this particular case, inorder successor can be obtained by finding the minimum value in right child of the node.
